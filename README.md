# CountryCode

This project shows how to retrieve the international code number from the cellular network and display a picker which contains all the country and their international code number. 

It is possible to check if the phone number inserted is correct by adding the [libPhoneNumber library](https://github.com/iziz/libPhoneNumber-iOS) and commenting out the function in the code.
